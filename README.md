# QrCodeScanner2024

The **QrCodeScanner2024** is a Python project designed to work with the 2024 scouting app. It allows you to scan QR codes and collect data, which is then stored in both a CSV file and an Excel file for easy viewing and analysis.

## Features

- **QR Code Scanning**: The scanner reads QR codes and extracts relevant information.
- **Data Storage**:
    - Raw data from QR codes is stored in a CSV file (`data.csv`).
    - Processed data is appended to an Excel file (`scouting_data.xlsx`).

## Usage

1. Run the `main.py` script to start the QR code scanner.
2. Point the scanner at a QR code to extract data.
3. The raw data will be saved in the `data.csv` file.
4. Processed data will be appended to the `scouting_data.xlsx` Excel file.
